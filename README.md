Maximizes Efficiency with Automation
The late DevOps authority Robert Stroud said DevOps is all about "fueling business transformation" that encompasses people, process and culture change. The most effective strategies for DevOps transformation focus on structural improvements that build community. A successful DevOps initiative requires a culture—or mindset—change that brings greater collaboration between multiple teams—product, engineering, security, IT, operations and so on—as well as automation to better achieve business goals.

What kind of tangible benefits can DevOps bring? By managing engineering processes end to end, DevOps emphasizes deploying software more often, in a reliable and secure way through automation.

Optimizes the Entire Business
System architect Patrick Debois, best known as the creator of the DevOps movement, says the biggest advantage of DevOps is the insight it provides. It forces organizations to "optimize for the whole system," not just IT siloes, to improve the business as a whole. In other words, be more adaptive and data-driven for alignment with customer and business needs.

Improves Speed and Stability of Software Development and Deployment
A multi-year analysis in the annual Accelerate State of DevOps Report has found that top-performing DevOps organizations do far better on software development/deployment speed and stability, and also achieve the key operational requirement of ensuring that their product or service is available to end users. But given the somewhat fuzzy definition of DevOps, how can an organization determine if its DevOps initiative is paying off? The 2019 Accelerate report also names five performance metrics—lead time (i.e., the time it takes to go from code committed to code successfully running in production), deployment frequency, change fail, time to restore and availability—that deliver a high-level view of software delivery and performance, and predict the likelihood of DevOps success.

Gets You to Focus on What Matters Most: People
People, not tools, are the most important component of a DevOps initiative. Key roleplayers (i.e., humans) can greatly increase your odds of success, such as a DevOps evangelist, a persuasive leader who can explain the business benefits brought by the greater agility of DevOps practices and eradicate misconceptions and fears. And since automated systems are crucial to DevOps success, an automation specialist can develop strategies for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring that production and pre-production systems are fully software-defined, flexible, adaptable and highly available
